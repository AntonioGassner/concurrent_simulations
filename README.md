# concurrent_simulations

same as the previous project, but we're trying to slim it down to only 1 container for the simulation.

Also the simulation now is taken from:
https://bitbucket.org/proslabteam/multirobotsimulation/src/logs/
instead of a dummy simulation we just used to test our project

After cloning the repo, run build.sh to build images, then run n_sim.sh to run n concurrent simulations
